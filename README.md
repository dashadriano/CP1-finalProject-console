```

The `.gitignore` file only caters to Visual Studio and VS Code users. For merge pushes from developers that use other IDEs, contact the repository owner: [@dashadriano](https://https://github.com/dashadriano)

# Development
The program only utilizes a single `.cs` file. Other files included are needed for it to run, as well as other build files that will be included in the instantiation of your C# Project locally.

The code flow is regulated through `running`, a boolean attribute of the main class. Comments are included for other segments of the code to aid collaborators in skimming the code before edits. 

A security liability for the project, noticeably, is the addition of the password text files in this repository, as well as storing plain-text passwords. 
Although the addition of the text files for passwords will not be removed due to this being an academic project that needs to include the password text files for demonstration purposes, hashing may be added to the security feature of the app soon.
